  "ABOUT_INTRO": "<i>Population.io</i> aims to make demography – the study of human populations – accessible to a wider audience. We believe that demographic data can play an important role in understanding the social and economic developments of our time. Our hope is that people from all walks of life, in all ages and across all countries will explore a new perspective of their own life and find their own place in the world of today and tomorrow.",
  "ABOUT_CREDITS_CORE": "<i>Population.io</i> has been developed by <a href='http://blogs.worldbank.org/team/wolfgang-fengler'>Wolfgang Fengler</a>, together with <a href='http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/researchPrograms/WorldPopulation/Staff/K-C-Samir.en.html'>K.C. Samir</a> and <a href='http://benedikt-gross.de/'>Benedikt Groß</a>.",
  "ABOUT_CREDITS_SUPPORTED": "The project is a volunteer effort which has been supported by the <a href='http://data.worldbank.org/'>World Bank Data Group</a> and the <a href='http://www.iiasa.ac.at/'>International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis</a> (IIASA). The team also appreciates the partnership with the United Nations Population Division, which is providing the estimates and projections, on which our model is based on (see methodology). And just has been possible with the generous volunteer contributions of (latest to oldest):",
  "ABOUT_CREDITS_CONTRIBUTERS": "<a href='http://lukaszcaputa.eu/'>Łukasz Caputa</a> (js developing/consulting mobile apps), Alexandra Colón and Laura Jaramillo (Translations ES), <a href='http://trojniak.net/'>Rafał Trójniak</a> (backend/cloud computing), <a href='http://andrewwhitby.com/'>Andrew Whitby</a> (algorithms and implementation in Python), <a href='http://www.wu.ac.at/sozio/institut/personalextern/tkriszti'>Tamás Krisztin</a> (algorithms and implementation in Python), <a href='http://jk-lee.com/'>Joey Lee</a> (maps, GIS and R to Python porting), <a href='http://www.47nord.de/'>47 Nord</a> (layouts and implementation α version) and Emi Suzuki (demographic data).",
  "ABOUT_DISCLAIMER": "The interpolated values used in the application have been developed by the team of <i>Population.io</i> and were derived from different sets of estimates and projections published in the <a href='http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/'>United Nations Population Division’s</a> <a href='http://esa.un.org/wpp/'>World Population Prospects, the 2012 Revision</a>. They reflect the most up to date estimates for each country as well as for the world as a whole. There remain data quality issues, especially for developing countries. It is also important to note that, especially for the projection of life expectancy, the system is calculating the mid-points of probability functions (see section on methodology). Life expectancy, however, is determined by many factors and <i>Population.io</i> only highlights three of them: existing age, gender and country of birth/residence. Life expectancy will also be shaped by many future developments, some of which will be unforeseen.<br> <i>Population.io</i> does not take any responsibility for the accuracy of the data and will invest in upgrading the system as more data and the results of additional modelling become available.",
  "ABOUT_DISCLAIMER_TITLE": "Disclaimer",

  "METHODOLOGY_INTRO": "<i>Population.io</i> uses official demographic data produced by the United Nations and published in the World Population Prospects (see data sources for details) most of which is available in annual or 5-year cycles. <i>Population.io</i> uses the past estimates for 1950-2010 and the medium population projection up to 2100 and interpolates the distribution daily for the World and for 200 countries (excluding few countries with small population size) and uses the UN’s estimates and projections of life tables for interpolating individual life expectancy by date and place of birth.
